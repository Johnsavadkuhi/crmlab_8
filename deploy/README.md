# Production deployment (`10.10.10.122`)

The production topology is a single HTTP origin:

- Frontend: `http://10.10.10.122`
- REST API: `http://10.10.10.122/api`
- WebSocket: `http://10.10.10.122/socket.io`
- Uploaded files: `http://10.10.10.122/uploads`
- Private backend listener: `0.0.0.0:4000`

Nginx serves the built SPA and proxies API, uploads, and Socket.IO to the Node
process. React Router refreshes fall back to `index.html`.

## Server setup

After installing Node.js, MongoDB, Nginx, and PM2, clone the project at
`/home/slb/crmlab` and run the automated setup as the `slb` user:

```bash
cd /home/slb/crmlab
./deploy/setup-server.sh
```

The script runs `npm ci`, creates `apps/api/.env` when absent, generates four
independent 64-character secrets, builds both apps,
starts or reloads PM2, installs the Nginx symlink, validates Nginx, reloads it,
and checks the backend directly before checking the public API endpoint. If the
backend fails, it prints the latest PM2 logs and stops before changing Nginx.
Existing non-placeholder secrets are never overwritten. It grants the Nginx
worker traversal permission on `/home/slb` and
`/home/slb/crmlab`, plus read-only access to
`/home/slb/crmlab/dist/web-fsa`; it does not make other home files
world-readable.

Uploaded files are stored outside the repository. By default, the backend uses
`crmlab-uploads` inside the home directory of the user running Node.js/PM2. It
creates the directory recursively at startup and refuses to start with a clear
error when the directory is not writable. Set the optional `UPLOAD_DIR`
environment variable to use a different location; relative overrides are
resolved against the backend process working directory.

The API build also compiles the shared `@role-dashboard/authz` workspace package
to production JavaScript before PM2 starts; PM2 never executes TypeScript source.

The production deployment uses the existing local MongoDB database named `test`:

```text
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test
LEGACY_DATABASE_NAME=test
```

The setup script repairs these two values in an existing `apps/api/.env`, which
prevents an older `enterprise_dashboard` configuration from surviving a PM2
reload. It preserves other settings and all existing non-placeholder secrets.
In production, this file is authoritative over environment values retained by
earlier PM2 processes. The API verifies `LEGACY_DATABASE_NAME` at startup and
refuses to run against the wrong database. `apps/api/.env` remains on the server
and is gitignored.

Verify after deployment:

```bash
curl -fsS http://10.10.10.122/api/health
curl -I http://10.10.10.122/
curl -I http://10.10.10.122/projects/example
```

The configured private-IP deployment intentionally uses host-only,
`SameSite=Lax`, non-Secure cookies because it is plain HTTP. When TLS is added,
set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`; keep `SameSite=Lax` for this same-origin topology.

## HTTPS setup (`crm.lab`)

The HTTPS Nginx configuration expects these files to exist before setup:

```text
/etc/ssl/crmlab/certs/crm.lab.crt
/etc/ssl/crmlab/private/crm.lab.key
```

Make sure `crm.lab` resolves to the server, then run:

```bash
cd /home/slb/crmlab
./deploy/setup-server-https.sh
```

This uses `deploy/nginx/crm.lab.conf` and `ecosystem.https.config.cjs`, replaces
the enabled HTTP site symlink, sets the application and Socket.IO origins to
`https://crm.lab`, enables secure host-only cookies, reloads PM2, validates
Nginx, and verifies the HTTPS health endpoint. The frontend uses same-origin
paths, so the API, Socket.IO, and uploads are available at
`https://crm.lab/api`, `https://crm.lab/socket.io`, and
`https://crm.lab/uploads`. The certificate must be trusted by the server
running the setup script as well as by client browsers.
